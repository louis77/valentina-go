; each subnet is prepended by a '-' or '+' sign. Plus means allow, and minus means deny.
; If the subnet mask is omitted, like "-1.2.3.4", then it means a single IP address.
; Mask may vary from 0 to 32 inclusive. On each request, the full list is traversed,
; and the last match wins.
; The default setting is to allow all (empty list).
